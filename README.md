# Autonomous DJI Tello Drone Navigation with Obstacle Avoidance

This project implements an autonomous drone navigation system for the DJI Tello quadcopter. It uses a grid-based map, real-time obstacle detection via computer vision, and the A* pathfinding algorithm to enable safe navigation in an indoor prototype environment modeled after TUM Campus Heilbronn.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Enable a DJI Tello drone to autonomously navigate a predefined grid map while dynamically detecting and avoiding obstacles using its onboard camera.
- **Path Planning**: Implemented using the A* algorithm for efficient route finding.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Real-time visual detection using OpenCV with edge detection and brightness thresholding.
- **Execution**: The drone continuously recalculates its path if an obstacle is detected, ensuring collision-free navigation.

## 🔧 Installation

Clone the project and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wassim-mezghanni/MechTayara
cd tello-drone-navigation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Running the Project
1.Power on the DJI Tello drone.

2.Connect your computer to the Tello Wi-Fi network.

3.Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```
The drone will take off, follow the computed path, detect obstacles, and re-plan its route as needed.
